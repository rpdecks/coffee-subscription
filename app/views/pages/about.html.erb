    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Process</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      We roast 1,000-2,000 pounds of coffee per month, carefully selecting beans from the world's 
      best coffee-growing regions. Each batch is roasted to perfection, ensuring optimal flavor 
      and freshness.

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      We roast to order, which means your coffee is never sitting on a shelf. From roaster to your 
      door in days, not weeks or months.
