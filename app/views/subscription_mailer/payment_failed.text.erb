Payment issue with your coffee subscription

Hi <%= @customer&.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

<% bags_per_delivery = @subscription.quantity.presence || @plan.bags_per_delivery %>
We ran into a problem processing the payment for your <%= @plan.frequency.titleize %> · <%= pluralize(bags_per_delivery, "bag") %> subscription.

No worries — this happens from time to time.

What you can do:
- Check that your payment method is still valid
- Make sure your card hasn’t expired
- Update your payment details if needed

Once your payment method is updated, we’ll take care of the rest and continue your subscription as usual.

Update Payment Method:
<%= @update_payment_url %>

If you have any questions or need help, just reply to this email and we’ll take care of it.
