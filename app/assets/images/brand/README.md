# Brand Assets (Web)

This folder contains **web-ready exports** used by the Rails app.

## What belongs here

- SVG logos/icons used in views
- PNG fallbacks for social sharing
- Cultivar icon SVGs

## What does NOT belong here

- Large working files (Figma exports archives, PSD/AI source files)
- Print-ready multi-page PDFs for packaging (keep those under `docs/brand/print/` or in a separate print handoff location)

## Conventions

- Prefer SVG for icons/logos.
- Keep filenames stable once referenced by views.
- If you regenerate assets, try to keep the same viewBox and aspect ratio to avoid layout shifts.
